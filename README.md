<h1>DFT Draw</h1>

<i>(generated by ChatGPT)</i>: Imagine a quirky digital artist armed with a magic wand called the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). 
With a mischievous grin, they take an innocent SVG file as their canvas. With a swift wave of the wand, 
the DFT begins its enchanting dance, unraveling the secrets hidden within the file's coordinates. 
As if casting a spell, it transforms the discreet points into a mesmerizing visual symphony. 
Lines, curves, and shapes emerge, merging art and mathematics in a harmonious display. 
Behold, as the SVG file comes to life, an artistic spell woven by the magical power of the DFT.
